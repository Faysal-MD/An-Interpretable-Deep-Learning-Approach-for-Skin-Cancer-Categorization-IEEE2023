# An-Interpretable-Deep-Learning-Approach-for-Skin-Cancer-Categorization

### üìå Abstract
<h4 align="justify" >
Skin cancer is a serious worldwide health issue, precise and early detection is essential for better patient outcomes and effective treatment. In this research, we use modern deep learning methods and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) approaches to address the problem of skin cancer detection. To categorize skin lesions, we employ four cutting-edge pre-trained models: XceptionNet, EfficientNetV2S, InceptionResNetV2, and EfficientNetV2M. Image augmentation approaches are used to reduce class imbalance and improve the generalization capabilities of our models. Our models decision-making process can be clarified because of the implementation of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). In the medical field, interpretability is essential to establish credibility and make it easier to implement AI driven diagnostic technologies into clinical workflows. We determined the XceptionNet architecture to be the best performing model, achieving an accuracy of 88.72%. Our study shows how deep learning and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) can improve skin cancer diagnosis, laying the groundwork for future developments in medical image analysis. These technologies ability to allow for early and accurate detection could enhance patient care, lower healthcare costs, and raise the survival rates for those with skin cancer.
